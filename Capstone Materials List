Capstone materials list

I was having trouble uploading files to GitHub (perhaps the result of a computer system upgrade?) and sent them via email instead.  I will try again to upload them here.  

The set of materials includes: 

- plots_small.xlsx (a 10-line sample of my "Mapping Yosemite National Park" set) 
- Brown_Capstone.py (an iPython notebook containing my results)
- GBrown_vis_screenshot.png (a screenshot of one of my bokeh visualizations)
- Proposal/Results/Conclusions
